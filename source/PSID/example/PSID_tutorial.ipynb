Note that in general $y_k$ and $z_k$ could also be any other two signals (e.g. brain activity from two regions or even non-neural signals), but here we will refer these signals as neural activity and behavior, respectively.

There are many equivalent ways of writing a latent state model such as this one, but PSID learns the one that uses minimal number of dimensions to explain behavior as parsimoniously as possible (you can find the precise definition in the paper). Critically, PSID can learn this minimal model (with only $x_k^{(1)}$) without having to also learn the rest of the model (the $x_k^{(2)}$ part).

        "`nx` determines the total dimension of the latent state and `n1` determines how many of those dimensions will be prioritizing the inclusion of behaviorally relevant neural dynamcis (i.e. will be extracted using stage 1 of PSID). So the values that you would select for these hyperparameters depend on the goal of modeling and on the data. Some examples use cases are:\n",
        "- If you want to perform dimension reduction, `nx` will be your desired target dimension. For example, to reduce dimension to 2 to plot low-dimensional visualizations of neural activity, you would use `nx=2`. Now if you want to reduce dimension while preservising as much behaviorally relevant neural dynamics as possible, you would use `n1=nx`. \n",
        "- If you want to find the best fit to data overall, you can perform a grid search over values of `nx` and `n1` and pick the value that achieves the best performance metric in the training data. For exmaple, you could pick the `nx` and `n1` pair that achieves the best cross-validated behavior decoding in an inner-cross-validation within the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# How to pick the horizon `i`?\n",
        "The horizon `i` does not affect the model structure and only affects the intermediate linear algebra operations that PSID performs during the learning of the model. Nevertheless, different values of `i` may have different model learning performance. `i` needs to be at least 2, but also also determines the maximum `n1` and `nx` that can be used per: \n",
        "```\n",
        "n1 <= nz * i\n",
        "nx <= ny * i\n",
        "```\n",
        "So if you have a low dimensional y or z, you typically would choose larger values for `i`, and vice versa. It is also possible to select the best performing `i` via an inner cross-validation approach similar to `nx` and `n1` above."
