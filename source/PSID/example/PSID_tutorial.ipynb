There are many equivalent ways of writing a latent state model such as this one, but PSID learns the one that uses minimal number of dimensions to explain behavior as parsimoniously as possible (you can find the precise definition in the paper). Critically, PSID can learn this minimal model (with only $x_k^{(1)}$) without having to also learn the rest of the model (the $x_k^{(2)}$ part).
